<p>Dear {$data['Account']['label']}:</p>

<p>RE: Lead Abatement Notification for {$project_address}</p>

<p>This is to confirm that on {$revised_date} we received a revision to the lead abatement notification for {$project_address}.  The projected start date is {$phase_1_start_date} and the projected end date is {$phase_1_end_date}.  If this changes again, you will need to submit another revised lead abatement notification with the new dates.</p>

<p>Please note that you may be subject to an on-site inspection by our staff at any time during the lead abatement project. In addition, please note that the lead abatement report required by Iowa Administrative Code 641â€”Chapter 70 must be completed no later than 30 days after the lead abatement project is finished.  You will need to complete an abatement report no later than {$data['report_due_date']} if you do not send us another revised notice to change the projected ending date.  We have attached information to remind you what is required for this report.</p>
 
<p>If you have any questions, please contact our office at 800-972-2026.</p>
